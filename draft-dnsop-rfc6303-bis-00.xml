<section anchor="updates"><name>Updates to 6063</name>
<t>Please update Section 8 of <xref target="RFC6303"></xref> &quot;IANA Considerations&quot; with the following text:</t>
<t>OLD:</t>
<t>This registry can be amended through &quot;IETF Review&quot; as per [RFC5226].
   As part of this review process, it should be noted that once a zone
   is added it is effectively added permanently; once an address range
   starts being configured as a local zone in systems on the Internet,
   it will be impossible to reverse those changes.</t>
<t>NEW:</t>
<t>This registry can be amended through &quot;Expert Review&quot; policy (Section 4.5 of [RFC8126]).
   As part of this review process, it should be noted that once a zone
   is added it is effectively added permanently; once an address range
   starts being configured as a local zone in systems on the Internet,
   it will be impossible to reverse those changes. More guidance for Designated
   Experts is provided in Section TBD.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="guidance"><name>Guidance for Expert Reviews</name>
<t>In changing the approval to &quot;Expert Review&quot;, there should be some additional guidance.
Here are some examples (not all mandatory) on what the Reviewer should look for:</t>

<ol>
<li><t>Should have at least an internet-draft written which can explain the usage.</t>
</li>
<li><t>The various Working Groups in the IETF should have</t>
</li>
<li><t>Must be approved by someone named Tim.</t>
